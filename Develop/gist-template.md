# Corbin's RegEx tutorial (Matching an HTML Tag)

Hello user! Today, I'll be explaining the functionality of a concept of the coding world called a "Regular Expression". 
However, the name may decieve you because these expressions are far from regular. When the word expression comes to mind, we all start to think back to high school math expressions, such as, y = mx + b or the pythagorean theorem. These expressions, in fact, are far more difficult to understand.

## Summary

HTML Tag Matching RegEx

/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

First of all, every RegEx starts with /^ and ends with $/. Now, in order to have this regular expression search for and match an html tag, we have to go over what an html tag consists of. <header> </header> is an opening and closing html tag that allows a developer to insert a header onto the page they are building. All we have to do now is specify what to look for within the RegEx.
